# Caldera WordPress Framework

This is a meta package that is designed to be the sole [Caldera Framework](https://github.com/CalderaWP/caldera) dependency of a WordPress plugin or site that use the Caldera framework.

This gives us a single place to version all of the required dependencies, and single place to update them. It is my intention to use this package to automate npm/yarn installing the JS packages.
Later, we will make a Slim and/or Laravel package like this that doesn't include the WordPress layers.

When you create a React app with create-react-app, you can update the app config beacuse the generated app has [react-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) as a dependency. This is our react-scripts. Add this as a composer dependency to your plugin, and use the version constraint in your composer.json to update the framework or to prevent the framework from updating. 

## Overview 
This is a composer meta package.
